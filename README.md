# GenerateLeastUsedList.sh

This script gets a list of all packages on the system and identifies the least used packages. The idea was to find out what packages are least used so that we can uninstall them if required to free us space.

The script was written in a few hours to solve a specific problem so it doesn't have any error checking etc so please use with caution.
